//! v1.2.0: per-rule runtime controls — the concurrent-connection cap and the
//! restart cancellation channel.
//!
//! ## Why this state lives per RULE, not per listener
//!
//! A single TCP rule binds up to TWO listeners (IPv4 and IPv6, see the
//! `(Protocol::Tcp, NodeTransport::Raw)` arm in `manager::apply_config`). If the
//! live-connection counter were owned by a listener, a dual-stack rule would
//! admit `max_connections` on v4 PLUS `max_connections` on v6 — silently double
//! the configured cap. The counter therefore hangs off the rule and both
//! listeners share one `Arc`, exactly like the rule's rate limiter.
//!
//! ## Why a cancellation channel is needed at all
//!
//! Each accepted connection is driven by a DETACHED `tokio::spawn` task.
//! Aborting the accept-loop task does NOT cascade to those children: the
//! listener stops accepting, but every established connection keeps forwarding
//! (verified empirically — a post-abort read/write round-trips fine). So
//! "restart a rule" cannot be implemented as abort-and-rebind; that would only
//! re-bind the port and shed nothing, which is the entire point of the feature.
//!
//! Instead every connection task selects on `RuleGate::cancel`. Bumping the
//! generation via `RuleRuntime::cancel_all` wakes them all, they drop their
//! sockets, and the peers see the connection close.
//!
//! ## When `apply_config` cancels
//!
//! A fingerprint change (new targets, new rate cap) tears the listener down and
//! rebuilds it, but deliberately leaves live connections alone — that has been
//! the behaviour since v0.3.6 and users rely on editing a rule without kicking
//! everyone off. An explicit restart cancels, and config protocol v8 adds one
//! security exception: rotating a preset-tunnel link key is credential
//! revocation, so `apply_config` also cancels those old authenticated streams.
//! Ordinary target, path, limit, and listener edits still drain naturally.
